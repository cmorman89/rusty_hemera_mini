# Rusty Hemera (Mini)

## Purpose:

This is a sub-project of the NyxEngine repo. It is a minimalistic version of the terminal rasterization module, `HemeraTermFx`, used for testing and debugging as I convert some core components of the NyxEngine to Rust.

### Note:

I am learning Rust as I go, so this code may not be idiomatic Rust -- or even correct Rust. But, I've always found the best way to learn is to bite off more than you can chew...and chew like hell until it makes sense. :)
